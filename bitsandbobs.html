    <h2>Bunny Flip (2013)</h2>
	<p>Back in highschool, I was in the school's video editing class. The segments we created would generally appear on the school's News show, Cat's Eye.
	However, most of my segments were either too short, too weird, or too obnoxious to appear on the show. Here is one of them.</p>
	<video width ="480" height="360" preload="metadata" controls aria-label="A small cute and realistic bunny is in a field over a serene, space like backdrop. 
	The cute bunny character jumps up and down, moving from the left side of the screen to the right.
	After disappearing off the right side of the screen, the bunny comes back, and does a flip. After performing the flip, the bunny explodes into a blaze of glory.">

	<h2>Bunny Flip 2 (2014)</h2>
	<p>The sequel absolutely no one asked for. For some reason, on a winter day in late 2014, I decided to do the impossible. I decided to up the ante in 
	the bunny flip series. I added guns, even more explosions, and characters you fall in love with and care about. This is the last video in the bunny flip 
	extended universe to date.</p>
	<video width ="1280" height="720" preload="metadata" controls aria-label="A cute realistic bunny is seen holding a gun in a war torn city block. The bunny shoots a gun to fend off a threat off-screen. From the right side of the screen,
	the threat becomes visible. In a surprising twist of fate, it is another bunny! The bunny then does a flip onto the bunny holding the gun, causing the bunny
	with the weapon to explode into a fireball.">
