	<h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Kyle Carlson. Since I was young, I've been a hobbyist game developer.
	I've made many different types of games, from FPS, to side scrolling platformers. Each project I have worked on
	has taught me something new, and improved my abilities. On this site, you can view all of my past and current projects.</p>
