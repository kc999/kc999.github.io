	<h2>Untitled FPS Project</h2>
    <p>This is the project I have been working on for the better half of 2025. I wanted to create a fast past action game, with cool movement techniques like diving.
	I also want it to be pretty over the top, similar to a John Wu movie. The game F.E.A.R. also played a big inspiration for some of the plans for the gameplay.
	About a year and a half ago, I moved over from the Unity engine to Godot. I have to say, I do like Godot a lot more than Unity. It's completely free and open source,
	which means you can make any changes you want to the engine. And with any game you release commercially, you don't owe any royalties. Getting this far with this Project
	took a lot of work. With Unity, I had almost no issues importing animations for my models in to the engine. With Godot, I pretty often run in to trouble. It's not a huge
	deal as I know what to expect now, but some of the documentation doesn't do a great job of explaing things in my opinion. I still don't have a name for this project yet, 
	and I haven't had a ton of time to work on it since I started school again, but it's definitely something I'm going to return to when I have the time.</p>

	each other to show the animations. The gun is also fired, and the knife is shown doing a slashing movement.">
